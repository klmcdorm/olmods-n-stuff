### ol2blk

Python 3 script which converts Overload levels (.overload) to Descent block files (.blk), which can then be imported into most Descent level editors.

#### Usage

Run using Python and supply the file path of your level.
```
py -3 ol2blk.py path/to/your-level.overload
```
The converted block file will have the same name and location but with an added .blk extension.
